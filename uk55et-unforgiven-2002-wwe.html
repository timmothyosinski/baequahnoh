The ratings are Meltzer's, and as always are his subjective opinion. Last time I did this list, I did not have the Oakland JBA vs. Glamour Girls match. (https://www.reddi.

Since all women's Money in the Bank ladder matches thus far have taken place VSPLANET.NET: Гробовщик vs Брок Леснар, Unforgiven. I think it’s fair to say that speculation for 2K20 won’t start until May of next year or so but given that Matt Hardy has officially retired and Jeff appears to be on his way out, would you play a Hardy Boyz Showcase? I had a few concepts for matches, and thought I would share those.
